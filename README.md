# Starter React App

This is a template repo for a quick react app.
Doesn't contain anything fancy, just a setup for quickly developing a React app with Typescript, my style system and some settings and configuration that I like.
As a plus though it can deploy to github pages.

## Run the project 🏃

```bash
npm run serve
```

Then go to `localhost:3000`

## Deploying 🚀

There is a `Deploy Project` workflow that can be manually triggered.
